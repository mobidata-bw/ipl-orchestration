-- Each configuration parameter exists within a scope.
-- Configuration parameters like plan_filter.statement_cost_limit that exist in a *more secure* scope than `user` (e.g. `superuser` or `sighup`) *do not* get adapted when changing to a different role (`web_anon`) by impersonating it via `SET ROLE`!
-- > This is because according to the pg docs executing SET ROLE does not cause new configuration values to be set, this only happens at login time. I have an example of this here.

-- However, we can still define a cost limit for operations on the *`postgrest` user* [1] (PostgREST uses it to connect to the DB, before switching to `web_anon`); PostgREST then re-applies it manually when it switches the role (`SET ROLE web_anon`) in each transaction [2].
-- Because that means that even PostgREST proper can't run very expensive queries (e.g. the schema introspection query at startup) anymore, we need to find a balance between not hindering PostgREST and preventing excessive queries by users. 1000000 is roughly equivalent to 0.2s-5s of execution time.

-- This currently doesn't work as expected though, PostgREST doesn't seem to re-apply `plan_filter.statement_cost_limit` to `web_anon`. [3]

-- Limit postgrest's & web_anon's queries by the query planner's estimated cost.
